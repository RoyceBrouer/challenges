      This is the three little pigs short story. Once upon a time, there were
      three little pigs and the time came for them to seek their fortunes and
      build their houses. The first little pig built his house of straw while
      the middle brother decided to build a house of sticks. They were done with
      building their houses very quickly and without much hard work. The third
      pig who was the oldest amongst them decided to build a house of bricks. He
      did not mind doing some hard work because he wanted a strong house as he
      knew that in the woods nearby, there was a wolf who liked to catch little
      pigs and eat them up.
